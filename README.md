This is the source code of the Aeolus website and here are some things we will have to work on before getting on board for people.

  1) Figure out how the content/images are handled here, strip it out, and replace it with our compressed images.
  2) Remove the additional pages and only keep four, landing, about, achievements, and contact pages in the end.
  3) The landing page will have a 3D Aeolus PESU logo or a nice-looking plane on a canvas with webGL, any of the two is fine.
  (Hopefully, the design team will be onto it, if that never works out we can pick up something with Spline or Threejs.)
  4) The rest of the pages will have the necessary titles, content, images, and not much graphics to keep things very minimalistic and simple.
  5) The Contact page will just include a simple form with Formspree.
  6) Depending on the number of posts available with the content team we will decide whether or not to implement a CMS with Firebase before deploying.
  7) Essentially this whole process will revolve around changing the existing components to react components wherever necessary.
  We'll do a simple Create React App, HTML to JSX, and so on.
  8) Minify the code and compress the images before deploying, standard. (https://gtmetrix.com/ in the end to see if this is any decent at all.)

For any queries reach out to Viikram or Rehan.
