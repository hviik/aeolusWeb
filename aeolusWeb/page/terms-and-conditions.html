                  cancelled for any reason, the Empty Leg Charter will similarly
                  be cancelled. In such circumstances, HYER will endeavour to
                  inform the Customer of such cancellation without delay, with

                  in connection with the performance of an Itinerary. HYER shall

                  agrees that HYER shall be entitled to request payment of the
                  sum on hold from the Customer&rsquo;s credit card. In case a

                  time change, Passenger manifest change, change of airport or
                  additional Flight requirements) in respect of one or more
                  itineraries being undertaken by the operator under a Flight
                  booking and such requests are accommodated by the Operator
                  (which shall be at the Operators&rsquo; sole discretion), HYER
                  will issue an amended or replacement Flight Confirmation and
                  the Customer will pay on demand any additional costs set out
                  therein.

                  (b) refund of pre-authorised payments taken by HYER from the
                  Customer&rsquo;s credit card.

                  4.14 Unless agreed in advance of the Flight, Wi-Fi charges are

                  will be passed onto the Customer to be paid on receipt of the
                  invoice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4.15 If the Customer pays the Charter Price by bank transfer
                  within&nbsp; 1 week of the proposed date of the Itinerary,
                  then HYER might request that the Customer provides to HYER
                  his/hers credit card details, which HYER may complete a
                  pre-authorisation of the relevant Charter Price plus the 4%
                  transaction fee payable pursuant to clause 4.5. If: (a) the
                  relevant payment by bank transfer is not received by
                  HYER&rsquo;s bank within 2 working days (being any day other
                  than a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday when banks are
                  generally open for normal business in Amsterdam) before the
                  departure date, or (b) the Customer requests that HYER takes
                  the relevant payment by credit card, then the pre-authorised
                  payment of the Charter Price plus the 4% transaction fee will
                  be taken from the Customer&rsquo;s card. If a bank transfer is
                  received by or on behalf of the Customer after HYER has taken
                  the relevant pre-authorised sums from the Customer&rsquo;s
                  credit card, then the bank transfer will be refunded to the
                  Customer. In case the pre-authorised payment is refunded to
                  the Customer&rsquo;s credit card the amount will be the
                  Charter Price less the 4% transaction fee paid and any fees or
                  charges levied on HYER in connection with refunding such
                  pre-authorised credit card payment.

                  6.4 In the event of any delay (other than any delay for
                  technical reasons that the responsibility for which shall lie
                  with the Operator) deviation or diversion of any flight, the
                  Customer shall be solely responsible for any cost for
                  accommodation, refreshments, meals, transportation or any
                  other additional costs, expenses, losses, damages or
                  liabilities of whatsoever nature incurred in respect of the
                  Customer&rsquo;s Passengers wherever and howsoever the same
                  shall arise. All such costs, expenses, losses, damages or
                  liabilities incurred by the Operator shall be reimbursed by
                  the Customer to the Operator`s demand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6.5 Where an Operator makes HYER &nbsp;aware of changes to an
                  Itinerary (including the departure time(s)), HYER shall
                  endeavour to communicate such changes to the lead Customer
                  named in the Booking Confirmation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6.6 In the event that any Passenger of the Customer is refused
                  entry at any destination airport, the Customer shall indemnify
                  and keep indemnified HYER or the Operator, in respect of that
                  refusal (including but not limited to charges, fee, penalties,
                  imposts or other expenses levied upon the Operator or HYER
                  &nbsp;by any immigration authority) and, also, all cost or
                  expense incurred by the Operator for any arrangements made by
                  the Operator to return such Passengers to the country from
                  which such Passenger was originally carried.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6.7 Customers shall at all times ensure that HYER has been
                  provided with their updated contact details, including but not
                  limited to telephone numbers (landline and mobile) and a
                  monitored email address. HYER &nbsp;shall have no liability
                  whatsoever for any losses sustained by a Customer due to
                  HYER`s inability to contact them using their disclosed contact
                  details.

                <p>
                  6.8 The execution of the Itinerary depends on Flight
                  operability. Events such as (but not limited to) &nbsp;actual
                  weather conditions, airport opening hours, air traffic
                  control, slots, Aircraft defect, overflight and landing
                  permissions might interfere with the operation of the Flight.
                  In case any of the mentioned circumstances force the Itinerary
                  to be cancelled or the Aircraft be diverted to an alternative
                  airport, be forced to return to base or suffer a technical
                  failure, HYER shall use its reasonable endeavours to provide
                  assistance in sourcing alternative means of transport for the
                  completion of the Itinerary, whether from the original
                  Operator or an alternative Operator/transport provider. In
                  arranging any such alternative transport with an alternative
                  Operator/transport provider, HYER act solely as the Customer's
                  broker, with such transport being subject to the Terms and
                  Conditions of the relevant Operator/transport provider. Unless
                  otherwise agreed by HYER, the cost of any such alternative
                  transport shall be for the account of the Customer named in
                  the original Booking Confirmation.

                  <strong> A &ndash; </strong> In case of delays resulting from
                  weather, HYER shall inform the Customer of the potential new
                  departure time and date for the safe performance of the
                  Itinerary.

                  <strong> B &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>In the event of unforeseeable
                  Maintenance ("AOG"), the Charter Operator will try to find a
                  solution internally and send another aircraft to the fleet as
                  a replacement. However, should no other aircraft be available
                  or economically feasible to operate an AOG replacement, the
                  Charter Operator will do its best to organise a sub-charter
                  aircraft from a third-party operator from the open market. In
                  case the substitution involves additional cost, such
                  additional cost shall be notified to the Client, who shall be
                  entitled to either accept the additional cost or decline the
                  offer of alternative carriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>C &ndash; </strong>In case of service disruption (such
                  as but not limited to adverse weather conditions, change or
                  cancellation of slots, traffic control disruption, airport
                  operational time restrictions) that incur any part of the
                  itinerary not being able to be executed as described or on
                  time, the Charter Operator will do its best to organise an
                  alternative carriage to deliver the Client to the final
                  destination. In case the substitution involves additional
                  cost, such additional cost shall be notified to the Client,
                  who shall be entitled to either accept the extra cost or
                  decline the offer of alternative carriage. In case the Client
                  does not accept an alternative carriage that delivers the
                  Client to the final destination and does not involve
                  additional cost to the Client, the Charter Operator is
                  entitled to consider the segment as executed, and no refund
                  rights arise to the Client.

                  <li>
                    Flights opened for pre-booking, passengers pay a deposit
                    amount to secure their seats instead of the entire ticket
                    price.

                  <li>
                    Clients that reserved a seat while the flight is on
                    pre-booking must pay the remaining amount within 24 hours
                    after the flight has been activated. If payment is not
                    received within this time, the client seat can be put for
                    sale to other passengers and the client is not entitled to a

                  <li>
                    Flights pending activation and accepting pre-booking are not
                    confirmed flights. Therefore Hyer is not liable or
